      I'm Dustin Davisson, and am an SRE at Kohls.  I love what I do and the challengers of working at scale.  Automation of
      of repeating tasks and toil, CI/CD, Security, and day two operations are what drive me.  I can write software and run it,
      currently Staff SRE at Kohls, working in Infrastructure.  My current personal drives are post deploy automation, automated
      validation and always driving towards deeper observability.  I'm nearing the end of a front end software engineering bootcamp,
      and looking forward to my next learning journey.  A day not learning is a day wasted. Use the right tool for the job, and the platform where possible.
