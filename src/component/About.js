    <p>
      I'm Dustin Davisson, and am an SRE at Kohls.  I love what I do and the challengers of working at scale.  Automation of
      of repeating tasks and toil, CI/CD, Security, and day two operations are what drive me.  I can write software and run it,
      currently Staff SRE at Kohls, working in Infrastructure.  My current personal drives are post deploy automation, automated
      validation and always driving towards deeper observability.  I am always learning and looking forward to what's next, while
      continuing to understand how to apply new ideas to old systems.  Modernization is an ongoing project that never ends.
